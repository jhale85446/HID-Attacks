# HID-Attacks
This repository contains Arduino code and Metasploit modules that are part of an ongoing HID Attack Vector project. This project was part of my creative component for a masterâ€™s degree in information assurance from Iowa State University.

The Arduino code was developted for the teensy 3.2 device.

More information including wiki pages on how to use all of this will be published soon.
