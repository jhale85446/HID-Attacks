# HID-Attacks
This repository contains Arduino code and Metasploit modules that are part of an ongoing HID Attack Vector project. This project was part of my creative component for a masterâ€™s degree in information assurance from Iowa State University.

The Arduino code was developted for the Teensy 3.2 device.
